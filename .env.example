# Where is Firefly III?
#
# 1) Make sure you ADD http:// or https://
# 2) Make sure you REMOVE any trailing slash from the end of the URL.
# 3) In case of Docker, refer to the internal IP of your Firefly III installation.
#
# This value is not mandatory. But it is very useful.
#
FIREFLY_III_URL=

#
# Imagine Firefly III can be reached at "http://172.16.0.2:8082" (internal Docker network or something).
# But you have a fancy URL: "https://personal-finances.bill.microsoft.com/"
#
# In those cases, you can overrule the URL so when the CSV importer links back to Firefly III, it uses the correct URL.
#
# 1) Make sure you ADD http:// or https://
# 2) Make sure you REMOVE any trailing slash from the end of the URL.

# Set your Firefly III Personal Access Token
# You can find create a Personal Access Token on the /profile page (at the bottom)

# - Do not use the "command line token". That's the WRONG one.
# - Do not use "APP_KEY". That's the WRONG one.

# You can also use a public client ID. This is available in Firefly III 5.4.0-alpha.3 and higher.
# This is a number (1, 2, 3). If you use the client ID, you can leave the access token empty and vice versa.

# When you're running Firefly III under a (self-signed) certificate,
# the CSV importer may have trouble verifying the TLS connection.
#
# You have a few options to make sure the CSV importer can connect
# to Firefly III:
# - 'true': will verify all certificates. The most secure option and the default.
# - 'file.pem': refer to a file (you must provide it) to your custom root or intermediate certificates.
# - 'false': will verify NO certificates. Not very secure.

#
# If you want, you can set a directory here where the CSV importer will look for import configurations.
# This is a separate setting from the /import directory that the auto-import uses.
# Setting this variable isn't necessary. The default value is "storage/configurations".
