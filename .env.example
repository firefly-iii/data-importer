# Firefly Data Importer (FIDI) configuration file

# Where is Firefly III?
#
# 1) Make sure you ADD http:// or https://
# 2) Make sure you REMOVE any trailing slash from the end of the URL.
# 3) In case of Docker, refer to the internal IP of your Firefly III installation.
#
# Setting this value is not mandatory. But it is very useful.

#
FIREFLY_III_URL=

#
# Imagine Firefly III can be reached at "http://172.16.0.2:8082" (internal Docker network or something).
# But you have a fancy URL: "https://personal-finances.bill.microsoft.com/"
#
# In those cases, you can overrule the URL so when the data importer links back to Firefly III, it uses the correct URL.
#
# 1) Make sure you ADD http:// or https://
# 2) Make sure you REMOVE any trailing slash from the end of the URL.

# - Do not use the "command line token". That's the WRONG one.
# - Do not use "APP_KEY" value from your Firefly III installation. That's the WRONG one.

# If set to true, the data import will not complain about running into duplicates.
