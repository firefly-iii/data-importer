# Firefly Data Importer (FIDI) configuration file

# Where is Firefly III?
#
# 1) Make sure you ADD http:// or https://
# 2) Make sure you REMOVE any trailing slash from the end of the URL.
# 3) In case of Docker, refer to the internal IP of your Firefly III installation.
#
# Setting this value is not mandatory. But it is very useful.
#
# This variable can be set from a file if you append it with _FILE
#
FIREFLY_III_URL=

#
# Imagine Firefly III can be reached at "http://172.16.0.2:8082" (internal Docker network or something).
# But you have a fancy URL: "https://personal-finances.bill.microsoft.com/"
#
# In those cases, you can overrule the URL so when the data importer links back to Firefly III, it uses the correct URL.
#
# 1) Make sure you ADD http:// or https://
# 2) Make sure you REMOVE any trailing slash from the end of the URL.
#
# IF YOU SET THIS VALUE, YOU MUST ALSO SET THE FIREFLY_III_URL

# Set your Firefly III Personal Access Token (OAuth)
# You can create a Personal Access Token on the /profile page:
# go to the OAuth tab, then Personal Access Token and "Create token".
#
# - Do not use the "command line token". That's the WRONG one.
# - Do not use "APP_KEY" value from your Firefly III installation. That's the WRONG one.

# This is a number (1, 2, 3). If you use the client ID, you can leave the access token empty and vice versa.

# This means that the data importer will not import duplicates, but it will not complain about them either.

# You have a few options to make sure the data importer can connect

# If you want, you can set a directory here where the data importer will look for import configurations.
